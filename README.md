Created a database of instagram clone and created tables of Instagram most usable data which everyone look for users, followers, hashtags, likes, comments and photos and inserted the online available existing datas and performed data extraction for different queries like who is gonna win the  most like on a photo competition and business related questions on when will it be suitable to launch the particular post (those days when max users register and max of them upload the photos on id.). It helps to look for the userâ€™s nature of what kind of posts and images he likes and to email about instagram to most inactive users.
